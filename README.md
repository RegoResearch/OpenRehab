# OpenRehab #
## Low-cost Open Rehabilitation Platform ##

Hello, this is OpenRehab.

OpenRehab is an open rehabilitation platform for patients who require rehabilitation exercise.
Rehabilitation is compulsory procedure if you are injured by brain disease, spinal cord injury, and orthopedic surgery.
However, it requires relatively a lot of money.

We would like to provide a simple, low-cost, and entertaining rehabilitation system like Nintendo Wii Fit and Ring Fit.

I suppose to use Nordic Thingy 52 sensor that you can obtain by just $40.
